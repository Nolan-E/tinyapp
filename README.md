# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Initial Setup

Install all dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```
#### ***If you have issues installing `bcryptjs`, refer to [npm Install Issues](#npm-Install-Issues)***
<br>
Run the development web server:

```shell
node express_server.js
```
Open web browser and enter the default URL:
```browser
http://localhost:8080/
```

## Additional Features
Added the following additional routes:
- Catch-all `GET` route: Redirect non-useful requests:
  ```javascript
  app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.redirect('/login');
  });
  ```
- Catch-all `POST` route: Status code & redirect non-useful requests:
  ```javascript
  app.post('*', (req, res) => {
    res.status(400).redirect('/login');
  });
  ```

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cookie-session

## npm Install Issues
This TinyApp uses the `bcryptjs` package for encryption by default. If you have issues installing, try `bcrypt`  package, locked to 2.0.0 by using the following install method:
```shell
npm install -E bcrypt@2.0.0
```
After installing `bcrypt`, open up the **[`express_server.js`](express_server.js)** file and replace `bcryptjs` with `bcrypt`, as shown below:
```javascript
// before: using bcryptjs
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
// after: using bcrypt
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
```

## Known Issues
- Collapsible navbar button for smaller devices does not work properly. Will be fixed in later commit. Please use full browser size for the time being.

## Future Updates
- Implement error message on the browser HTML while redirecting to /login when no user is logged in and the /urls page is requested.
- Error status code pages (400, 403, 404, etc.) render in EJS templates instead of basic html error page.
- Add Analytics & Method Override "stretch" features.
